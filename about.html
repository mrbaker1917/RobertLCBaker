            <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
            <p>In 1938, the Department of Transport and Defence formed a committee to develop plans for an airport on
                the Brethour family farm near Sidney, BC. In the summer of 1939, the construction of the airport began
                and in the early spring of 1941 the paving of the runways was completed and the airport was operating as
                a combined RCAF and RAF base under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Building 51, which is
                still in use as our Squadron Headquarters, was built in 1941 as a theatre and recreational centre for
                No. 32 Operational Training Unit of the Royal Air Force. The address is now 1979 DeHavilland Way named
                for the DeHavilland aircraft now manufactured by Viking Air a short 2-minute walk from the cadet hall.
            </p>
            <p>After the war, the building remained vacant for a number of years and, in early 1950, was used by the
                army militia and Army Cadets. By 1956 the building was again vacant, until 1958, when the Sidney Kinsmen
                Club obtained the building from the Department of National Defence for the use of Air Cadets.</p>
            <p>The 676 Kinsmen Squadron was formed on July 3, 1958, and consisted of 32 cadets with 7 officers and
                instructors. The squadron continued to be sponsored by the Sidney Kinsmen club until 1982, when this
                function was assumed by a parent sponsoring committee. In 1993 a non-profit charitable organization was
                formed under the name 676 Kittyhawk Sponsoring Committee Society. This body is now the sponsor and its
                Board of Directors form the Sponsoring Committee.</p>
            <p>The name "Kittyhawk" was adopted in June 1982 in recognition of the famous P-40 Kittyhawk fighter
                aircraft, which was flown from the Pat Bay Air Force Base in Sidney, BC, during the Second World War.
                This aircraft was in service with the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1941 to 1946. During this period it
                was employed by squadrons in Canada, Alaska, Europe, and North Africa. It was flown from Patricia Bay by
                the 111, 132, 133, and 135 Fighter Squadrons.</p>
