      <h2>
        On July 1, 2024, Robert L. C. Baker passed away. He was 90 years old.
      </h2>
      <p>
        He loved Canada, so maybe it is fitting that he died on Canada Day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bob was a good, kind-hearted person, friendly, curious, and loving. He
        loved life very much, and that is probably why he struggled so much to
        let it go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert is survived by his daughter Carol Elizabeth Baker, his two
        sons, Mark Baker and Tim Baker, as well as his nine grandchildren:
        Evan, Jillian, and Brandon, Elyse and Samantha, Lily and
        Jasper, Willow and Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert was born on December 26, 1933, in Vulcan, Alberta, but raised
        in Coaldale, Alberta. He became a social studies teacher after
        graduating from the University of Alberta, from which he eventually
        also earned a Masters degree. He soon became a vice-principal, and
        then for many years a principal at several schools in the Edmonton
        Public School System.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1956, he met the love of his life, Loretta May Hoffos, and they
        were married on August 10, 1957. They had five children from 1960
        (Carol Elizabeth) to 1971 (Daniel), with three other boys in between
        (Phil, Mark, and Tim). They lived in Edmonton, Alberta, for about 15
        years, and then in Sherwood Park, Alberta, from 1972 until 2017.
        Loretta worked as a music teacher at Mills Haven Elementary School for
        many years, and then as the Fine Arts Consultant for the Elk Island
        School District.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert retired at the young age of 55, in 1989. But he did not really
        stop working then. He helped fund raise for the building of a
        performing arts centre in Sherwood Park, Festival Place, and then
        became a school board trustee in the Elk Island School District. He
        and Loretta also opened a bed and breakfast in Sherwood Park, before
        finally really retiring in the mid-1990s. They then set about
        travelling all over the world, from Bakersfield, California, to
        Istanbul, Mexico, Cuba, Holland, the UK, and then cruises across
        Europe, including a brief visit to St. Petersburg, and the Baltic
        States. They also spent some winters in Maui, Hawaii, and Mesa,
        Arizona, and took their last cruise through the Panama Canal in 2017.

      <p>
        Robert lived a long life, full of many joyful moments and sad times
        too. He was a great listener, always wanting to help people,
        especially to help his children, but many others as well. He loved to
        laugh, to tell stories, to talk and joke around with one and all. He
        made a deliberate and long-standing effort always to tell a caller or
        visitor how wonderful it was to hear from them, to thank them for
        taking the time to see him. We take from this habit a desire always to
        make others know how much he appreciated them as human beings. He endured
        the death of his true love, Loretta, in 2020, and the death of two of
        his sons, Dan and Phil, in July 2021. He loved to perform and listen to
        sacred choral music, especially Handel's Messiah, and Bach's Cantatas. 
        Robert lived a long, modest, and very human life. He will be missed by 
        all who knew him.
