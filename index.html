          On July 1, 2024, Robert L. C. Baker passed away. He was 90 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          He loved Canada, so maybe it is fitting that he died on Canada Day.
        </p>

          Bob was a good, kind-hearted person, friendly, curious, and loving. He
          loved life very much, and that is probably why he struggled so much to
          let it go.
        </p>

          Robert was born in Vulcan, but raised in Coaldale, Alberta, and became
          a social studies teacher after graduating from the University of
          Alberta. He soon became a vice-principal, and then for many years a
          principal at several schools in the Edmonton Public School System. He
          retired at the young age of 55 (1988). But he did not really stop
          working then. He helped fund raise for the building of a performing
          arts centre in Sherwood Park, Festival Place, and then became a school
          board trustee in the Elk Island School District. Along with my mom
          Loretta, he also opened a bed and breakfast in Sherwood Park, before
          finally really retiring in the mid-1990s. He and Loretta then set
          about travelling all over the world, from Bakersfield, California, to
          Istanbul, to Mexico, Cuba, Holland, the UK, and then cruises across
          Europe, including a brief visit to St. Petersburg, and the Baltic
          States. They also spent some winters in Maui, Hawaii, and Mesa,
          Arizona, and took their last cruise through the Panama Canal in 2017.
          Dad lived a long life, full of many joyful moments and sad times too.
          He was, to me at least, a great listener, and always wanting to help,
          especially to help his children, but others as well. He loved to
          laugh, to tell stories, to talk and joke around with one and all. He
          made a deliberate and long-standing effort always to tell a caller or
          visitor how wonderful it was to hear from them. I take from this habit
          a desire always to make others know how much he appreciated them as
          human beings. I cannot imagine how I would have got along without him.
          I will miss him so.
