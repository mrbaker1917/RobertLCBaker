            <h2>What is Air Cadets?</h2>
            <p>
                The Air Cadet Program is one of the largest federally sponsored youth
                programs in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a national program for young Canadians aged 12 to 18 who are
                interested in participating in a variety of fun, challenging and
                rewarding activities while learning about the Sea, Army and Air
                activities of the Canadian Armed Forces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cadets are encouraged to become active, responsible members of their
                communities. They make valuable contributions to Canadian society on a
                daily basis in terms of environmental, citizenship and community
                activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cadets also learn valuable life and work skills such as teamwork,
                leadership and citizenship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cadets are not members of the Canadian Armed Forces, nor are they
                expected to join the military. While they are introduced to Sea, Army
                and/or Air activities of the Canadian Armed Forces and certain
                traditions, they are also introduced to many other respectable career
                choices that are available to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the Cadet Program, the Government of Canada is investing in
                today's youth and Canada's future.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Cadet Program is community-based and it succeeds through strong
                community support and involvement. Cadets, in turn, make valuable
                contributions to their communities.
            </p>

            <h2>How Do I Join 676 Kittyhawk Squadron?</h2>
            <p>
                If you have turned at least 12 years old, the best time to register
                and join is on any Thursday starting in September. This is when the
                majority of other first-time cadets join, so you won't miss out on any
                of the training year and won't have to try to catch up to everyone
                else.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cadets who join after March 31st are unable to complete the training
                year requirements and are therefore ineligible for summer training
                opportunities. We will nevertheless accept registrations up until the
                first week in June, when we stand down for the summer.
            </p>

            <h2>Membership Requirements:</h2>

            <p>
                The Cadet Program is open to youths between 12 and 18 years of age and
                is an organization based on military values.
            </p>

            <h3>Air Cadets has three aims:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    citizenship
                </li>
                <li>to promote physical fitness</li>
                <li>
                    to stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land, and air
                    activities of the Canadian Forces
                </li>
            </ul>
